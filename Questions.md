Explain in detail the workings of a dynamic array:

- What is the runtime complexity to access an array, add or remove from the front, and add or remove from the back?

Acccess =

Add or Remove from front = O(n) linear time

Add or Remove from back = O(1) constant time

- What is the worse case scenario if you try to extend the storage size of a dynamic array?

Explain how blockchain networks remain in consensus:

- What does a node do if it gets a message from another in the network with a new block?

Check the header and the transactions to make sure they conform to the consensus rules.

- Why can't someone cheat by changing a transaction from an earlier block to give themselves coins?

Because if they changed a transaction from a previous block they would have to go and change all the blocks that came after it.
